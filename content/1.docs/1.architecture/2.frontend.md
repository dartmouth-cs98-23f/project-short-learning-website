## UX/UI Design

We set out to design a good user experience for our users. This meant:

- An app that is intuitive to use. No page glitches. No weird finger gymnastics.
  - We chose to design our app in [Swift][swift], since native apps are more intuitive and interactive.
- A simple app that does not distract from content.
  - We chose to include a few pages that are well-considered feel intuitive to a user.
  - We chose a simple color scheme that is easy on the eyes.
- A clean app; no cluttered pages or unnecessary information.
- A fast app; no waiting for pages to load or long videos to download or buffer.
  - We chose to use [HLS][hls] streaming over serving videos directly from a database,
    so that videos are progressively loaded as the user watches them.
    in real-time, as the user views them.
