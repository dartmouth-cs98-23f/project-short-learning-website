- After we have tagged each second with relevant topics and subtopics,
  the next step is to clip the video into segments based on the topics.

### Algorithm

- We use a sliding window to detect changes in the topic of a video,
  Comparing with a sliding `mean` or `median` to compare the topics
  of the current window to the previous window.
- If the difference between the two is greater than a threshold,
  we consider the topic to have changed.
- We then save the `start` and `end` times of the window right before the topic changes.

We then use these `start` and `end` times to split the videos,
save raw files to [Amazon S3][s3], and save metadata to our API.
