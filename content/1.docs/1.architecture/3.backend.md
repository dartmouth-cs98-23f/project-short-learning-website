## Back-End Design Principles

We designed our backend around the following principles:

- **Scalability:** We want to be able to support as many users as possible, so our backend is designed to auto-scale when needed.
- **Security:** It is important that user data is protected. We ensure all incoming requests are authorized using access tokens.
- **Modularity:** We want the API to be extensible, so each user-facing feature is supported with its own
    collection and ways of interacting with it. This ensures each module does not affect other modules,
    and makes it easy to add new modules supporting new user-facing features.
- **Simplicity:** We chose the simplest design patterns, using [Express.js][express]'s structure of [models and controllers][models].
- **Speed:** We optimized our data-processing and database queries to make them as fast as possible.
- **Reliability:** We implemented our backend with [TypeScript][ts], ensuring type-safety
  and avoiding type errors which are prone in vanilla [JavaScript][js].
- **Testability:** We have a testing-suite of over fifty tests, built using [Cypress][cypress].
