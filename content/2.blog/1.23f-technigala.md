Discite is a platform for shortform learning.
We offer real-time streaming of short videos, with guiding "learning paths"
and ability to engage with and share clips to friends.

## Problems

Short-form content is the future of content consumption.
But short-form content is not optimized for _learning_, at least not yet.

Instead, it’s optimized for engagement.
TikTok and the likes try to lure you into doom-scrolling your time away.

We asked ourselves an important question &mdash; can a user have:

- Short-form content
- Optimized for and customized to their personal learning habits…
- Without predatory, dopamine-inducing hooks?

One may also wonder whether we should just retain long-form content for learning.
A side-effect of short-form content is a shrinking attention span,
which makes it increasingly tougher for learners to labor through long videos without losing interest.

- **Content creators recognize this, and want to make shorter content.**
- Even existing long-form content platforms such as YouTube are introducing short-form content on their platforms.

We commend that.
But the current approach to _serving_ short-form content is to randomly sequence videos on varying topics
and show them to the user in a feed. These videos will jump around entirely unrelated topics, depending
on what is _"hot"_ at the moment.
This sequencing is not optimized for learning, so we want to create a better solution that is
created for users who want to learn and not just be entertained.

We also recognize the existence of excellent platforms such as [Khan Academy][khan], but we think
there is a missed opportunity since they do not offer short-form content (sub-minute)
and also have no social features.

## Proposed Solution

At the start, we asked each other and some of our friends how we would envision learning in the current age
of short-form content and artificial intelligence.

This journey led us to Discite. Discite allows you to:

- Stream short, atomic clips addressing specific subtopics, through a mobile app, in real-time.
- Access a "flow" of such clips through a learning-path.
  No need to manually identify the next subtopic and the relevant clip.
- Engage with such clips and learning-paths.
- Add friends and share insightful clips or learning-paths with them.

A substantial amount of work certainly needs to be done to organize content into digestible clips and learning-paths
in order to make this a reality.
This work should not be creators' responsibility &mdash; creators should be free to focus on
_creating_ their best content, without worry of length, sectioning, or learning-paths.

We designed Discite to automate this process. Discite will:

- Automatically process a video and extract relevant topics and subtopics for each period,
  using machine learning models that take into account both visual and audio (transcript) context.
  :read-more{to="/docs/architecture/machine-learning"}
- Split the video into atomic clips, taking care to not section in the middle of an explanation.
  :read-more{to="/docs/architecture/clipping"}
- Tag each clip with the relevant topic, subtopic and fine-grained title.

## System Design and Architecture

Discite is mobile-first.
We have various components that work together to make this a reality.

- **Mobile App:** The mobile app is the primary interface for users to consume content.
  It is built using [Swift][swift].
  :read-more{to="/docs/architecture/frontend"}
- **Backend:** We use [Node.js][node] and [Express][express] for out backend, which provides a reasonable API between our user-facing app and our data.
  :read-more{to="/docs/architecture/backend"}
- **Database:** We use [MongoDB][mongo] to store our data, with well-designed and optimized schemas to ensure efficiency and scalability.
  :read-more{to="/docs/architecture/database"}
- **Video Streaming:** We use [HLS][hls] to stream videos to our users in real-time, with videos hosted on [Amazon S3][s3].
  :read-more{to="/docs/architecture/streaming"}
- **Machine Learning:** We use models built in [PyTorch][torch], [Scikit-Learn][sklearn], and [Gensim][gensim]
  to process videos and extract topics and subtopics.
  :read-more{to="/docs/architecture/machine-learning"}
- **Clipping:** We use [FFmpeg][ffmpeg] to split videos into atomic clips. We compute medians and means of topics
  to determine when to split a video.
