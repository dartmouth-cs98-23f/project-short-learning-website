Discite is a platform for shortform learning.
We offer real-time streaming of short videos, with guiding "learning paths"
and ability to engage with and share clips to friends.

## Problems

Short-form content is the future of content consumption.
But short-form content is not optimized for _learning_, at least not yet.

> **Warning** Instead, itâ€™s optimized for engagement.
TikTok and the likes try to lure you into doom-scrolling your time away.

We asked ourselves an important question:
Can a user have:
Short-form contentâ€¦
Optimized for and customized to their personal learning habitsâ€¦
Without predatory, dopamine-inducing hooks? 

1. Developing JavaScript applications with Webpack or any bundler requires to switch between your browser and terminal for debugging purpose.
2. Using `console.log` to debug when the app is server rendered requires to remember that logs will be displayed on the terminal when refreshing the page.

## [](#solutions)Solutions

1.  Forwarding Webpack build state right in the browser and display them in a fancy manner.

2.  Same for Hot Module Replacement (really useful when the project gets bigger and takes more time to re-build).

3.  Forwarding SSR logs to the browser in development mode

The purpose to these changes is to use the terminal for commands only.

Now you can focus right on your code and its visual result ðŸ™‚
