Discite is a platform for shortform learning.
We offer real-time streaming of short videos, with guiding "learning paths"
and ability to engage with and share clips to friends.

## Problems

Short-form content is the future of content consumption.
But short-form content is not optimized for _learning_, at least not yet.

Instead, it’s optimized for engagement.
TikTok and the likes try to lure you into doom-scrolling your time away.

We asked ourselves an important question &mdash; can a user have:

- Short-form content
- Optimized for and customized to their personal learning habits…
- Without predatory, dopamine-inducing hooks?
